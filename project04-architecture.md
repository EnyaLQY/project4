#  Topic
The topic we picked for this project is **Anime**. We want to introduce several manga or anime with their names, authors, stories, main characters and media sources. 


#  Ontology
An anime will have:
* Name
* Poster
* A general introduction about the released date and other basic facts (volumes, awards, etc.)
* Authors
* Story/Plot
* Main Characters (with pictures, names and descriptions)
* Music
* Link to the series

#  Taxonomy
* Anime Name
  - Picture of the anime
  - Facts
* About Author (with a picture)
* Plot Overview
* Main Characters
  - Character Name 1
    * Picture of the character
    * Story
  - Character Name 2
    * Picture of the character
    * Story
  - Character Name 3
    * Picture of the character
    * Story
 * Media
	 * TV series (Link)
	 * Music (Link)

#  Choreography
The anime list (navigation) will be in timely order, which is the released date. Since the anime we picked are mainly from Japan, the location and alphabet order seem not very effective in this case.

The contents in each anime page will start with its name and a poster. A brief introduction followed by the title will talk about some basics facts such as author, release date and volumes, etc. The next section will show more facts about the author. Then we will move to the plot overview and main character introduction (without spoiler!). If the readers are interested in these contents, they will check out the media links we provided in the end.

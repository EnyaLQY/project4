## Layout

- **Grid Layout** can provide the audience with selected pictures which can best attract the audience's attention. 

- One of the most important features that anime presents is its scenes. 

- The audience will quickly focus on their preferred style of painting with the help of **Grid Layout**.![Example](https://digitaltemplatemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Illustfolio-4.jpg)

- Inside the anime page I will use Z-pattern.

- A banner will provides scenes clipped from the anime.

- Information will be listed below telling the audience about its main characters and plot.

- After viewing the whole page, a button that link to the media will be provided on the right-down corner.

## Color Pallet

- When we mention anime, the first impression is always vigorous and vivid. 

- Therefore I decide to use warm and soft color for the webpage, especially the color of sakura, in order to provide a anime atmosphere.
- According to the anime's genre, the color of website may switch to cold colors in order to fit the theme.

## Typography

- For our website name, I choose Pokemon Font which best creates a feeling of anime(obviously).

- For our titles and paragraphs, I decide to use Pompiere which is a low contrast condensed sans serif font. It is kind of playful and a little sweet, which greatly improves the comfortable feeling a anime website can provide.
